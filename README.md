I currently work at [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/), helping government agencies serve their constituents more equitably and effectively using technology. I sometimes [write blog posts here](https://civic.io/) and say things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mheadd).

In the past, I have worked for:
  - [GSA/TTS](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services)
  - [City of Philadlephia](https://www.phila.gov/)
  - [State of New Delaware](https://dti.delaware.gov/)
  - [State of New York](https://www.nysenate.gov/)
  - [Code for America ](https://codeforamerica.org/)
