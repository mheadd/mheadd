:wave: I currently work at [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/) helping government agencies improve service delivery using technology. I sometimes [write blog posts here](https://mheadd.medium.com/), and my legacy personal website is [here](https://civic.io). I also sometimes say things on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@mheadd), and less frequently on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mheadd).

In the past, I have worked for:
